# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

RaceIQ is a full-stack racing telemetry analysis app supporting multiple racing games (currently Forza Motorsport, F1 2025, and Assetto Corsa Competizione). It receives real-time UDP telemetry packets from games at 60 Hz, stores lap data in SQLite, and provides a React dashboard with live visualizations, lap comparison, AI-powered analysis, and 3D car attitude rendering.

## Commands

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SERVER_PORT` | `3117` | HTTP/WebSocket server port |
| `UDP_PORT` | `5300` | Game telemetry UDP listen port |
| `DATA_DIR` | `./data` | Database and settings directory |

## Architecture

### Three-layer monorepo: `server/`, `client/`, `shared/`

**Server (Bun + Hono)**
- `server/index.ts` — Entry point: Bun.serve with HTTP + WebSocket upgrade on port 3117
- `server/udp.ts` — UDP socket listening for game telemetry packets
- `server/parsers/` — Game-specific binary packet parsers (dispatched via game adapter registry)
- `server/games/` — Server game adapters (parser binding, AI prompts) — see [Adding a New Game](#adding-a-new-game)
- `server/routes.ts` — Hono app composition; individual route files live in `server/routes/` (laps, sessions, settings, cars, tracks, tunes, ACC, F1 2025, misc)
- `server/ws.ts` — WebSocket manager, 30Hz throttled broadcast to all connected clients
- `server/pipeline.ts` — Telemetry processing pipeline (normalize → suspension fill → lap detect → sector track → pit track → track calibration → broadcast)
- `server/lap-detector.ts` — Detects lap boundaries from telemetry stream (per-game factory via adapter)
- `server/sector-tracker.ts` — Server-side sector timing (distance-fraction splits, estimated lap time vs reference)
- `server/corner-detection.ts` — Identifies racing corners from telemetry data (game-aware steering)
- `server/ai/` — AI analysis system (see [AI Analysis System](#ai-analysis-system))
- `server/db/schema.ts` — Drizzle ORM schema (profiles, sessions, laps, corners, lapAnalyses, compareAnalyses, trackOutlines)
- `server/db/queries.ts` — Database query helpers
- `server/db/migrations.ts` — Hand-rolled migration list (SQL array, version-tracked)
- `server/db/index.ts` — Runs migrations on startup via custom runner
- `server/tray.ts` — System tray integration (Windows)
- `server/update-check.ts` — Auto-update checker

### Database migration approach

Drizzle is used **only as a query builder and type-safe schema reference** — NOT for runtime migrations. Schema changes are managed via a hand-rolled migration system in `server/db/migrations.ts`. The app compiles to a self-contained Windows binary (`raceiq.exe`); Drizzle's `migrate()` reads SQL files from disk at runtime, which would break single-binary distribution. The custom system embeds all migration SQL directly in the compiled binary.

**To add a schema change:**
1. Edit `server/db/schema.ts` (keeps Drizzle types in sync)
2. Add a new entry at the bottom of `server/db/migrations.ts` with the next version number and the raw SQL
3. Do NOT use `bun run db:push` to apply schema changes — it is for dev introspection only and must never drop `schema_migrations` (protected via `tablesFilter` in `drizzle.config.ts`)

### Pipeline dependency injection

The pipeline uses `DbAdapter` and `WsAdapter` interfaces for testability:
- Production: `RealDbAdapter` (SQLite), `RealWsAdapter` (Bun WebSocket)
- Tests: `NullDbAdapter`/`NullWsAdapter` (no-op) or `CapturingDbAdapter`/`CapturingWsAdapter` (record calls)

### AI Analysis System

The AI system uses Mastra agents backed by Claude API with streaming and prompt caching.

**Agents** (`server/ai/agents.ts`):
- Lap Analyst — single-lap breakdown with corner-by-corner analysis
- Compare Engineer — head-to-head lap comparison (inputs-focused)
- Chat Agent — interactive Q&A about laps and comparisons

**Prompt files** (`server/ai/`): `analyst-prompt.ts`, `chat-prompt.ts`, `compare-engineer.ts`, `compare-chat-prompt.ts`, `inputs-compare-prompt.ts`, `corner-data.ts`, `format-tune.ts`

**Mastra directory** (`mastra/`): Agent definitions for the Mastra dev playground (`bun run mastra:dev`). Mirrors `server/ai/agents.ts` for local testing.

**Caching**: Analysis results cached in DB (`lapAnalyses` for single laps, `compareAnalyses` for lap pairs with a `kind` discriminator).

**Client (React 19 + Vite + TanStack Router)**
- `client/src/main.tsx` — App entry point
- `client/src/routes/__root.tsx` — Root layout with TanStack Router
- `client/src/routeTree.gen.ts` — Auto-generated route tree (do not edit manually)
- `client/src/stores/telemetry.ts` — Zustand store for WebSocket connection state, current packet, packets/sec, live history arrays
- `client/src/stores/game.ts` — Zustand store for active game context (gameId → route mapping)
- `client/src/stores/ui.ts` — Zustand store for UI state (settings modal, onboarding)
- Key components:
  - `LiveTelemetry.tsx` — Real-time telemetry dashboard
  - `LapAnalyse.tsx` — Lap analysis with corner data
  - `LapComparison.tsx` — Side-by-side lap comparison
  - `TrackMap.tsx` — Track visualization
  - `TelemetryChart.tsx` — Data charting (uplot)
  - `BodyAttitude.tsx` — 3D car orientation (Three.js / React Three Fiber)
  - `AiAnalysisModal.tsx` — AI-powered analysis via Claude API
  - `Settings.tsx` — App settings modal (UDP port, units)
  - `TuneCatalog.tsx` — Vehicle setup tuning

**Shared (`shared/`)**
- `shared/types.ts` — Telemetry packet types, enums, shared interfaces
- `shared/games/` — Game adapter registry and per-game adapters — see [Adding a New Game](#adding-a-new-game)
- `shared/car-data.ts` — Car model ID-to-name mapping (dispatches via game adapter)
- `shared/track-outlines/` — Track geometry data (JSON coords, sector definitions, named segments)
- `shared/tunes/` — Vehicle setup data (JSON)

### Data Flow

1. Game sends UDP packets → `server/udp.ts` receives and buffers
2. `server/parsers/index.ts` auto-detects game via `canHandle()`, decodes binary → typed telemetry object
3. `server/lap-detector.ts` tracks lap boundaries, saves completed laps to SQLite
4. `server/ws.ts` broadcasts live packet to all WebSocket clients
5. Client `telemetry.ts` Zustand store receives via WebSocket → React components re-render
6. Historical data fetched via REST API (`/api/laps`, `/api/sessions`, etc.)

### Key Conventions

- Path aliases: `@shared/*` → `./shared/*` (server/test), `@/*` → `./src/*` (client only)
- Client proxies `/api` and `/ws` requests to `localhost:3117` via Vite dev server config
- **API calls use Hono RPC**: import `client` from `@/lib/rpc.ts` (typed against `AppType` from `server/routes.ts`) — do not use raw `fetch` for API routes
- **gameId travels via `X-Game-Id` header** — not query params or effect-populated stores
- Database file: `data/forza-telemetry.db` (SQLite)
- Settings persisted to: `data/settings.json`
- UI components use shadcn (in `client/src/components/ui/`) with Tailwind CSS v4
- Client uses TanStack React Query for server state management
- 3D visualizations use React Three Fiber (Three.js wrapper for React)
- **Never fall back to "fm-2023"** when gameId is missing — make gameId required
- Prefer static `import` at top of file over `await import(...)` — don't copy existing dynamic-import patterns

### Custom Steering Wheels

The steering wheel displayed during live telemetry is file-driven. To add a custom wheel:

1. Place an image in `client/public/wheels/`
2. Supported formats: `.svg`, `.webp`, `.png`, `.jpg`
3. The filename (minus extension) becomes the display name

Example: `client/public/wheels/Logitech G Pro.png` → shows as "Logitech G Pro"

The wheel picker in Settings and Setup Wizard automatically discovers all images in that directory.

### Game Adapter System

The app uses a registry-based adapter pattern to support multiple racing games. Each game provides a `GameAdapter` (shared) and `ServerGameAdapter` (server-only) that encapsulate all game-specific behavior.

**Shared adapter** (`shared/games/types.ts` — `GameAdapter`):
- Identity: `id`, `displayName`, `shortName`, `routePrefix`
- Car/track resolution: `getCarName()`, `getTrackName()`, `getSharedTrackName()`
- Steering config: `steeringCenter`, `steeringRange` (used by corner detection)
- Coordinate system: `coordSystem` (used by track maps)
- Optional metadata: `carClassNames`, `drivetrainNames`

**Server adapter** (`server/games/types.ts` — `ServerGameAdapter`):
- Packet detection: `canHandle(buf)` — quick check if a UDP buffer belongs to this game
- Parsing: `tryParse(buf, state)` — parse buffer into `TelemetryPacket`
- Parser state: `createParserState()` — e.g. F1's multi-packet accumulator (null if stateless)
- AI analysis: `aiSystemPrompt`, `buildAiContext(packets)`

**Registries:**
- `shared/games/registry.ts` — `registerGame()`, `getGame()`, `tryGetGame()`, `getAllGames()`
- `server/games/registry.ts` — `registerServerGame()`, `getServerGame()`, `getAllServerGames()`

**Current adapters:**
- `shared/games/fm-2023/` + `server/games/fm-2023/` — Forza Motorsport 2023 (stateless parser, size-based packet detection)
- `shared/games/f1-2025/` + `server/games/f1-2025/` — F1 2025 (stateful multi-packet accumulator, magic bytes detection)
- `shared/games/acc/` + `server/games/acc/` — Assetto Corsa Competizione (shared memory reader on Windows)

### Adding a New Game

To add support for a new racing game (e.g. Gran Turismo):

1. **Add game ID** — Add `"gt7"` to `KNOWN_GAME_IDS` in `shared/types.ts`
2. **Create shared adapter** — `shared/games/gt7/index.ts` implementing `GameAdapter` (identity, car/track resolution, steering config, coord system)
3. **Create server adapter** — `server/games/gt7/index.ts` implementing `ServerGameAdapter` (`canHandle()`, `tryParse()`, `createParserState()`, AI prompts)
4. **Create UDP parser** — `server/parsers/gt7.ts` with binary parsing logic
5. **Register adapters** — Import and call `registerGame()` in `shared/games/init.ts`, `registerServerGame()` in `server/games/init.ts`
6. **Create client routes** — `client/src/routes/gt7.tsx` (layout with `<GameProvider gameId="gt7">`) and sub-routes in `client/src/routes/gt7/`
7. **Add game data** — Car/track CSVs in `shared/`, track outlines in `shared/track-outlines/gt7/`

See existing adapters (`fm-2023`, `f1-2025`, `acc`) for reference. Everything else (navigation tabs, car/track name resolution, corner detection, AI prompts, parser dispatch) is handled automatically by the registry.

### Pre-commit Hooks (Lefthook)

Installed via `postinstall` script. Runs in parallel on staged client files:
- **lint** — ESLint on staged `client/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}`
- **typecheck** — full client build (`cd client && bun run build`)

### AI Evaluators

Lap Analyst and Compare Engineer outputs are gated by deterministic scorers under `mastra/evals/scorers/`. The eval harness runs real fixture laps through an eval-only agent (pinned to `google/gemini-3-flash`), scores the output, and fails the build if any score drops below its threshold in `mastra/evals/index.ts::SCORER_THRESHOLDS`.

**Scorers (all deterministic, no LLM judge):**
- `output-shape` — analyst output parses against `AnalystOutputSchema` (`server/ai/schemas.ts`). Threshold 1.0.
- `corner-coverage` — fraction of the fixture's expected slowest corners mentioned. Threshold 0.7.
- `numeric-grounding` — fraction of `tuning[]` entries citing a concrete number-with-unit. Threshold 0.8.
- `unit-consistency` — metric fixtures must not leak imperial units, and vice versa. Threshold 1.0.
- `compare-directionality` — compare output correctly names the faster lap. Threshold 0.9.
- `chat-freeform-shape` — chat output is non-empty, cites real corners, no hallucinated corner names. Threshold 0.8.

**Schema source of truth:** every game adapter prompt (FM, F1, ACC, AC Evo) renders its JSON output shape via `renderAnalystSchemaForPrompt()` from `server/ai/schemas.ts`, so the scorer and the model's instructions stay in lockstep. Per-game prompts still own their own category guidelines and domain rules, but the shape is centralised.

**Running evals:**
```
bun run test:ai                  # runs test/ai-quality.test.ts
bun run ai:baseline              # snapshots scores to test/ai-fixtures/baselines/<sha>-<model>.json
```

Both commands require `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`); they skip cleanly when absent so forks and fresh clones don't flake.

**Adding a fixture:** see `test/ai-fixtures/README.md`. In short: export a real lap via `bun run laps:export --ids <id> -o test/ai-fixtures/packets/<id>.zip`, then add a matching JSON under `test/ai-fixtures/laps/` with an `expected` block pinning _signals_ (corner names, faster lap, setup direction) — not a reference answer. Signals survive prompt iteration; reference answers do not.

**CI:** a separate `ai-quality` job in `.github/workflows/build-test.yml` runs `bun run test:ai` after the main test job. Uses repo secret `GEMINI_API_KEY`; skips on forks where the secret is unavailable.

### Testing

Tests live in `test/` and use Bun's native test runner (`bun:test` with `describe`/`test`/`expect`). Tests that involve packet parsing must initialize game adapters first:

```typescript
import { initGameAdapters } from "../shared/games/init";
import { initServerGameAdapters } from "../server/games/init";

initGameAdapters();
initServerGameAdapters();
```

**Known issue**: ACC shared memory tests fail on macOS due to `@libsql/client` module resolution (Windows-only feature).

### CI/CD

- **PR/main**: GitHub Actions runs `bun test` and client build (`.github/workflows/build-test.yml`)
- **Release tags**: Windows x64 binary compilation via `.github/workflows/release.yml` — Bun compiles server to `raceiq.exe`, bundles with Vite client output into `raceiq-windows-x64.zip`

### Memory

Project memory is stored in `.claude/memory/` in the repo root (not the default `~/.claude/projects/` path). This is version-controlled so all contributors share context. Read and write memory files there.
